# MySQL-Notes
- These Notes do not cover whole SQL, it is just a basic and begineers friendly SQL Notes purely focused on Data Science as a goal to learn SQL. 
- Github offers many other features for DBMS as well, but just for sake of understanding every command.
- Notes has been uploaded in text file format, Where you can have a feel of mysql CLI as well.
- Installing Mysql Server on your pc is itself a big and tough task, I recommend install Mysql with help from some youtube videos might make it easier.
- hope you get a good knowledge from these Notes.
